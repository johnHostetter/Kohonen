# An adapted form of Kohonen's feature-maps algorithm

This repository contains an unfinished draft adapting Kohonen's feature-maps algorithm from:

R.W. Zhou, & C. Quek (1996). POPFNN: A Pseudo Outer-product Based Fuzzy Neural Network. Neural Networks, 9(9), 1569-1581.

The work was discontinued in favor of more viable and newer alternatives for the generation of fuzzy sets (e.g., Categorical Learning Induced Partitioning).
